This is poject names "Etch-A-Sketch", we have created a grid (not using css grid) but by using flexbox and some js manupulation
we have a colour box to choose colour from and have a 2 buttons (rainbow and random)
rainbow button changes the colour of the filler every 100ms and the random one will just give you a random colour from rgb(0,0,0) to rgb(255,255,255)

there is an input box, clear button, reset button for the creation and clearing purpose
input can take value from 1 till 100
